# Python Traversal Methods

## This program will create a Binary Tree as such
             8
           /   \
          5     4
         / \     \
        9   7     11
           / \      \
          1   12     3   
              /
             2

### STEP 1.
* Setup working environment, Header Notes/README.
I used Visual Studio Code and Python as my working environnment for this project. I then created a README file in my github account to display
and showcase my steps during the project. 

### STEP 2.
* The program will implement a class node where the root node and the remaning nodes will be added 
either on the left or right accordingly until the whole desired tree is built

### STEP 3.
* Once the Binary Tree is complete we can begin the traversal implementation

### STEP 4.
* An individual function is deployed for each of the following traversal methods
* In-Order
* Pre-Order
* Post-Order

### STEP 5. 
* Now that both the Binary Tree and the traversal methods are implemented we can
now we can run the program so that we can get the results for each traversal

### Result
* The result we are we expecting for each of the traversal methods is the following:
* inorder 9-5-1-7-2-12-8-4-11-3
* preorder 8-5-9-7-1-12-2-4-11-3
* postorder 9-5-1-7-2-12-4-11-3-8

### Final Comments:
* The application was a challenge considering how the tree needs to be implemented and each of the nodes 
needs to fall in place correctly for the traversal method to function correctly. 
For the traversal methods, once the first traversal method was deployed, the other two were simple to implement
because it was only matter of making the little tweaks on the code for the traversal to function as we expected.
